The language and its speakers
-----------------------------

Wersing (ISO 639-3: kvw) is a language spoken on the island of Alor in the Nusa
Tenggara Timur province of Indonesia. The speakers of Wersing traditionally live
in settlements scattered amongst other languages along the north, south and east
coasts of central-eastern Alor (Map 1). On the north coast, there are two
distinct settlements, one centred on the village of Adagai in the west and the
other around Taremana in the east. These villages are in close contact with
varieties of Abui and Kamang speakers respectively and villagers typically have
some competency in those languages. On the east coast, the Wersing settlement is
centred on the village Kolana, containing a mix of Wersing and Sawila speakers.
Along a small portion of the south coast, Wersing villages are strung from
Mademang in the West to Pureman in the East. These villages neighbour Kiraman-,
Manet- and Sawila-speaking villages. According to local traditions, the
settlements in Pureman on the south coast constitute the original Wersing
settlement, with the settlement on the east coast having occurred later and from
there further on to the north coast.

There are no reliable sources of how many Wersing speakers there are. The most
recent edition of the Ethnologue (Eberhard, Simons & Fennig 2020) cites Grimes’
et al. (1997: 65-66) estimate of 3,700 speakers. In the villages, Wersing
appears to be still being learnt by at least some children in places such as
Kolana (Emilie Wellfelt pers. comm.), Pureman (Hans Retebana pers. comm.) and
Mademang (personal observation). Shift to Indonesian or, better said, the local
variety of Malay spoken in Alor, is proceeding apace: schooling and literacy is
exclusively available in Indonesian, and increasingly speakers move away from
the villages of Wersing-speaking areas for the purposes of further education and
employment.

Wersing belongs to the Alor-Pantar subgroup of the language family known as the
Timor-Alor-Pantar family (Holton et al. 2012, Schapper et al. 2014, Schapper
2017). Wersing is part of the low-level East Alor sub-group, within which it
groups by itself, with Montane-East-Alor containing its neighbours, Kula and
Sawila, as a sister node (Schapper 2018). Recent higher classifications, such as
Ross (2005), have included the Timor-Alor-Pantar languages in the hypothesized
large family, Trans-New Guinea, but that link is not proven.

Alor is a small island where Papuan languages dominant. The surrounding islands
are inhabited by speakers of Austronesian languages (with a few exceptional
pockets of Papuan languages on distant parts of Timor). All of the Papuan
languages of Alor show layers of borrowing from Austronesian, but as a coastal
group, the Wersing have a more significant amount than most. In particular,
contact with the peoples of the northern coast of Timor and to the islands east
of Alor have left clear cultural and linguistic marks on the traditions and
language of the Wersing people (see Schapper and Wellfelt 2018).

Previous work on Wersing has been limited. I know of the following work. Mark
Donohue conducted several days of fieldwork in Kolana in the 1990s; this
resulted in a manuscript of a phonological sketch on the Wersing dialect of that
place (Donohue 1997) as well as scattered examples in published works (e.g.,
Donohue 2004: 226 on metathesis, 2008: 66-67 on alignment). A Wersing reader was
produced in the mid-2000s by Fredik Langko, a native speaker of Kolana Wersing
and retired primary school teacher, in order to support local content curriculum
(*muatan lokal*) teaching (Langko n.d.). Holton (2010) is a 400-item wordlist
collected in Kalabahi, the capital of Alor, with a Wersing speaker from
Taramana, on the north coast of Alor. A slightly extended version of the same
wordlist was collected by Choi (2015) for Maintaing dialect. Holton (2014)
includes a set of Wersing kin terms based on elicitation of genealogies.
Schapper & Hendery (2014) is a sketch grammar of Wersing Pureman, to which the
materials presented here provide some significant updates.

Bible translations are another potential source of material for the study of
Wersing. A preliminary version of the gospel of Mark in Wersing was translated
by Anderias Malaikosa (n.d.), a native speaker of Wersing and Sawila from
Kolana. Subsequent to the passing of Malaikosa in 2012, a team of native
speakers and bible translators from the Unit Bahasa dan Budaya has been working
on translations of further books of the bible on the basis of the Kolana dialect
(Unit Bahasa & Budaya 2017, 2019). As part of that work, Johnny M. Banamtuan has
presented a detailed analysis of metathesis in Wersing Kolana (Banamtuan 2018)
and developed together with the translation team a working orthography for the
Kolana dialect (Unit Bahasa & Budaya 2020).


Source of the data
------------------

All material in this dictionary was collected by the author working with
a single speaker, Hans Retebana, between 2012 and 2020.

Retebana is a native speaker of the Peitoko variant of the Pureman dialect on
Alor’s south-eastern coast. Retebana grew up in Peitoko speaking Wersing. In
late adolescence he moved to Kalabahi, the capital of Alor, where he lived and
worked in local government for the remainder of his life. He regularly visits
Pureman where many of his family still reside, but does not use Wersing on
a daily basis. As a result, Retebana’s active recall of certain lexical domains,
such as farming and subsistence, biota names as well as traditional religion, is
limited. His phonology and morphology form an internally consistent system (as
described below), but may not be typical of the Pureman speech community in
general.

The backbone of the lexical materials presented here were collected in an
initial intensive workshop of two weeks in Bali in 2012. In this time, the
present author and collaborator Dr. Rachel Hendery assembled a corpus of several
hundred elicited utterances, responses to five MPI stimuli tasks, and seven
narrative texts. On the basis of that initial work, a sketch of Wersing was
published (Schapper & Hendery 2014). As part of a comparative-historical
project, I continued work with Retebana on the lexicon of Wersing. Further
elicitation was conducted in Kalabahi as follows: two days in July 2013, two
weeks in November 2015, two weeks in April 2016, two weeks in April 2018 and
three weeks in March 2019. In these elicitation sessions, the emphasis of my
work was not on collecting more lexical items but rather was directed towards
getting accurate phonological renderings, particularly in regards to stress,
semantically differentiating lexical items which had been translated in the same
way into Indonesian, and collecting example sentences for each item.

The material presented here is thus significantly restricted by the limited
speaker base (one individual!) and the mode of its collection. The user should
be aware, therefore, of the imperfect and incomplete nature of these lexical
materials. I publish them here for the benefit of the Wersing community, of
Papuanists concerned with comparative-historical issues, and of linguists with
an interest in lexical typology.


Wersing phonology and morphology
--------------------------------

I do not include a sketch grammar here since this was already presented in
Schapper and Hendery (2014). Nonetheless, it is necessary to update and
elaborate on some aspects of the analysis of phonology and morphology based on
the further data collected subsequent to the publication of the 2014 sketch.
Where there are differences between Schapper and Hendery (2014) and this
publication, the reader should take the information presented here as
authoritative. I focus here on information that will be of use to the reader in
understanding the structure of the Wersing lexicon and this dictionary
representation of it.

### Phonology and orthography

*Phonemes.*
Table 1 shows the inventory of consonants, using both in IPA letters and in the
graphemes of the practical writing system. The /r/ phoneme is marginal in
word-initial position, being found in two known loans only. The /ɲ/ phoneme is
found initially in little over a dozen person forms all marked for the 1st
person plural exclusive, with one exception, /mleɲa/ ‘yesterday’. The phoneme
/ŋ/ is marginal in onsets; it is not found at all word-initially and in only
three lexemes as a medial onset. The phonemes /n/ and /ŋ/ merge in codas, with
[ŋ] being the only realization.

*Table 1.* Consonant phonemes (//) and their corresponding graphemes (&lt; >) in
the Wersing orthography

There are five vowels in Wersing. These are shown in Table 2. The vowel /o/
tends to be realized as [o] in closed syllables and [ɔ] in open ones.

<table class="table table-bordered">

</table>

*Table 2.* Vowel phonemes (//) and their corresponding graphemes (&lt; >)

*Vowel sequences.*
Sequences of a non-high vowel followed by a high vowel occur within a single syllable nucleus and can optionally be
realised as a diphthong. For example, /-pai/ ‘make’ is sometimes realised with
a steady low F1 followed by an abrupt jump to a steady high F1 [pai]. In other
instances, there is a smooth slide from a low point to a higher target [paj].
The phoneme /u/ can also be realised as [w] before another vowel. In the
“Pronunciation” field of each dictionary entry, I write vowel sequences that can
be realized as diphthongs with a glide (e.g., {pei} ‘pig’ [pej], {nau} ‘no’
[naw]). This is done as a contrast to sequences of vowels that are not in the
same syllable and therefore cannot be realized as diphthongs. In these cases, we
often find phonetic glides inserted, but these are not written in the practical
orthography used here (e.g., {uing} /ˈuiŋ/ ‘hide’ [ˈu.ʷiŋ], {diari} /diˈari/
‘fry’ [di.ˈʲari]).

Sequences of two like vowels sometimes arise in Wersing through affixation,
e.g., /lε-εsεl/ ‘APPL-tired’, /mi-ilεl/ ‘APPL-look’, /pkoda-a/ ‘burst-FIN’. In
such situations, vowels are typically realized with a weak intervening
epenthetic glottal stop or a slight pause. In the practical orthography, these
are written simply as double vowels, e.g., {leesel}, {miilel} and {pèkodaa}.

*Allophony.*
There is some allophonic variation in the realization of Wersing phonemes.
I discuss here those cases which also impact on the orthographic rendering of
words in this dictionary:

<ol>

  <li style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
    Word-initial /w/ may be elided on many, but not all, items before /o/ and /u/,
    e.g., /wota/ [wɔta ~ ɔta] ‘coconut’, /wuli/ [wuli ~ uli] ‘spill’. In these
    cases, I permit both renderings in the practical orthography, {wota} ~ {ota}
    ‘coconut’, {wuli} ~ {uli} ‘spill’.
  </li>

  <li style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
    There is no contrast between /n/ and /ŋ/ in codas. In the practical
    orthography used here, in codas {ng} is written, while in onsets {n} is
    used, e.g., {oming} ‘here.NFIN’ versus {omin-a} ‘here-FIN’.
  </li>

  <li style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
    Nasal assimilation is common, both within and across words, where final /ŋ/
    is adjacent to a consonant with another place of articulation: e.g.,
    /-maŋtaiŋ/ ‘strike’ can be realised as [-maŋtajŋ] or [-mantaiŋ]; /tεŋ=bo/
    ‘first.NFIN=EMPH’ can be realised as [tεŋ=bɔ] or [tεm=bɔ]. As a rule, I do
    not use nasal assimilated forms in Wersing orthography but maintain
    underlying /ŋ/ as {ng}.
  </li>

  <li style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
    Root-initial /j/ frequently weakens on prefixation, with the result the now
    adjacent vowels may be realized either distinctly with a weak intervening
    epenthetic glottal stop or as a single long vowel that  e.g., /lɛ-ˈjar/
    [lɛjar ~ laˀar ~ laːr] ‘tell a story’, or /gɛ-ˈjɛm/ [gɛjɛm ~ gɛˀɛm ~ gɛːm]
    ‘call him/her’.<a href="#ref1" id="1" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Such weak glottal stop epenthesis/vowel lengthening has also been observed on one vowel-initial item also: /le-adu/ ‘lean on’ [lɛadu ~ laʔadu ~ laːdu]. It may be that the root here is, in fact, /-jadu/."><sup>1</sup></a>.
    In the practical orthography, these items are written as realized by the
    speaker, e.g., /lɛ-ˈjar/ ‘tell a story’ can be written variably {lejar}
    ~ {laar}.
  </li>

  <li style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
    Final high vowels following a consonant can also be dropped. For instance:
    /-ˈwεri/ ‘ear’ can be realised as [-wεri ~ -wεr] and /t&lt;na~>ˈnasu/ ‘each’
    can be realised as [tənanasu ~ tənanas]. For consistency, I always write the
    final vowels with such items as these.
  </li>

  <li style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
    /o/ may be realized in some items as either [ɔ] or [u] finally and in some
    cases preceding a final high vowel, e.g., /bo/ [bɔ ~ bu] ‘clausal
    demonstrative’, /atoku/ [atɔku ~ atuku] ‘earth’, /adosi/ [adɔsi ~ adusi]
    ‘gourd’. However, I only render /o/ as orthographic {o} and never as {u}.
    Where /o/ can be realized as [u], I note this in the “Pronunciation” field
    as far as possible.
  </li>

  <li style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
    On a small number of items, an unstressed vowel can irregularly be reduced
    to schwa. For example, /miˈra/ ‘inside’ can be realised as [miˈra ~ muˈra
    ~ məˈra] or /giˈnuk/ ‘3.DU’ can be realised as [giˈnuk ~ gəˈnuk]. In the
    practical orthography, these items are written as realized by the speaker,
    i.e., {mira} ~ {mura} ~ {mèra} and {ginuk} ~ {gènuk}.
  </li>

</ol>

*Stress.*
Stress is unpredictable in Wersing, but Schapper and Hendery (2014) had not
identified stress-differentiated minimal pairs at the time of publication.
Since then, I have noted some, but the number remains small:

<table class="unstyled">
<tr><td>(1)</td><td>/aˈmi/ ‘breast’       </td><td>≠</td><td>/ˈami/ ‘there’</td></tr>
<tr><td>   </td><td>/aˈmuiŋ/ ‘submerge’   </td><td>≠</td><td>/ˈamuiŋ/ ‘cape’</td></tr>
<tr><td>   </td><td>/aˈtok/ ‘your stomach’</td><td>≠</td><td>/ˈatok/ ‘peck, lunge at’</td></tr>
<tr><td>   </td><td>/suˈak/ ‘prawn’       </td><td>≠</td><td>/ˈsuak/ ‘store sharp object’</td></tr>
</table>

Given the low functional load stress carries, I do not mark stress in the
practical orthography used here. The reader can check where stress falls in the
“Pronunciation” field of each entry.

*Vowel reduction and onset vowel epenthesis.*
The low functional load carried by stress today in Wersing is partly due to very
many historically pre-tonic vowels being lost from original initial CV
syllables.<a href="#ref2" id="2" data-toggle="tooltip" title=""><sup>2</sup></a>.
The loss of these pretonic vowels means that Wersing has a large number of roots
with underlying initial consonant clusters, i.e., have the shape CCV(C)(V)(C).
Most of these consonant clusters are broken up through vowel epenthesis between
C1 and C2. The epenthetic vowel may be [ə] or harmonised with the first vowel of
the root, as in the examples in (2). In the practical orthography used here, the
non-phonemic, epenthetic vowel is written with {è}.

<table class="unstyled">
<tr><td>   </td><td>Underlying         </td><td>Realisation        </td><td>Orthography</td><td>Etymology</td></tr>
<tr><td>(2)</td><td>/mˈtari/ ‘rosewood’</td><td>[məˈtari ~ maˈtari]</td><td>{mètari}   </td><td>&lt; PTAP *matari</td></tr>
<tr><td>   </td><td>/tpa/ ‘new’        </td><td>[tǝˈpa ~ taˈpa]    </td><td>{tèpa}     </td><td>&lt; PTAP *tipa</td></tr>
<tr><td>   </td><td>/mdi/ ‘plant’      </td><td>[mǝˈdi ~ miˈdi]    </td><td>{mèdi}     </td><td>&lt; PTAP *mudi[ŋ]</td></tr>
</table>

Some, but not all, underlying initial consonant clusters involving
plosive+liquid and fricative+plosive/liquid are permissible in surface forms. In
these situations, the writing of {è} is optional in the orthography. For
example:

<table class="unstyled">
<tr><td>   </td><td>Underlying          </td><td>Realisation                 </td><td>Orthography</td></tr>
<tr><td>(3)</td><td>/ski/ ‘arrow’       </td><td>[ˈski ~ səˈki ~ siˈki]      </td><td>{ski} ~ {sèki}</td></tr>
<tr><td>   </td><td>/slar/ ‘coral cliff’</td><td>[ˈslar ~ sǝˈlar ~ saˈlar]   </td><td>{slar} ~ {sèlar}</td></tr>
<tr><td>   </td><td>/priŋ/ ‘corpse’     </td><td>[ˈpriŋ ~ pǝˈriŋ ~ piˈriŋ]   </td><td>{pring} ~ {pèring}</td></tr>
<tr><td>   </td><td>/bloiŋ/ ‘write’     </td><td>[ˈblojŋ ~ bəˈlojŋ ~ boˈlojŋ]</td><td>{bloing} ~ {bèloing}</td></tr>
</table>

The use of {è} for the epenthetic vowel in the orthography is motivated by the
need to avoid the confusion of the Modern Indonesian orthography’s use of {e}
for both /e/ and /ə/. In examples of written Wersing that I have seen, native
speakers tend to replicate the Indonesia use of {e} for schwa. However, in
Wersing there are a number of lexical items that require /e/ to be
differentiated from the epenthetic vowel. For example, in an Indonesian-style
orthography, the lexical items in (4) would be both rendered as {meleng}:

<table class="unstyled">
<tr><td>   </td><td>Underlying       </td><td>Realisation      </td><td>Orthography</td></tr>
<tr><td>(4)</td><td>/mlɛŋ/ ‘night’   </td><td>[məˈlɛŋ ~ mɛˈlɛŋ]</td><td>{mèleng}</td></tr>
<tr><td>   </td><td>/ˈmɛlɛŋ/ ‘scared’</td><td>[ˈmɛlɛŋ]         </td><td>{meleng}</td></tr>
</table>

A more practical orthographic solution for the future may be not to write the
epenthetic vowel at all. However, the native speaker I worked with was reluctant
to have this, insisting that a vowel grapheme was needed.

*Echo vowels and vowel epenthesis between syllables.*
Word-final codas can be
brought into line with the preferred open syllable shape by means of an echo
vowel. An echo vowel is harmonized with the preceding phonemic vowel, as in (4).
Unlike an epenthetic vowel, an echo vowel is never schwa (e.g., /pis/ ‘mango’
can be realised as [pisi] but not \*[pisə]).

<table class="unstyled">
<tr><td>    </td><td>Underlying       </td><td>Realisation  </td><td>Orthography</td></tr>
<tr><td>(5) </td><td>/pis/ ‘mango’    </td><td>[pis ~ pisi] </td><td>{pis} ~ {pisi}</td></tr>
<tr><td>    </td><td>/bεb/ ‘palm top’ </td><td>[bεb ~ bεbε] </td><td>{beb} ~ {bebe}</td></tr>
<tr><td>    </td><td>/war/ ‘and’      </td><td>[war ~ wara] </td><td>{war} ~ {wara}</td></tr>
<tr><td>    </td><td>/pok/ ‘little’   </td><td>[pok ~ poko] </td><td>{pok} ~ {poko}</td></tr>
<tr><td>    </td><td>/tuk/ ‘short’    </td><td>[tuk ~ tuku] </td><td>{tuk} ~ {tuku}</td></tr>
</table>

Not all final Cs precipitate echo vowel insertion to the same extent. For
example, /pur/ ‘garden’, and /tam/ ‘grandchild’ are always found in the corpus
without echo vowels. By contrast, /pok/ ‘little’ and /pis/ ‘mango’, for example,
are found both with and without echo vowels, but more often with. That is,
liquids and nasals generally remain as word-final codas, but other underlying
consonant codas tend to have an echo vowel appended to them. The conditioning
factors for the (non-) appearance of the echo vowel remain to be determined by
means of a statistical analysis of a fuller corpus.

Consonant clusters across syllable boundaries, i.e., roots with the shape
(C)VC.CV(C), may also be broken up by vowel epenthesis where stress is on the
last syllable. Where these clusters are broken up, the epenthetic vowel is never
schwa but, like an echo vowel, always harmonized with the preceding vowel of the
root. For example:

<table class="unstyled">
<tr><td>    </td><td>Underlying              </td><td>Realisation              </td><td>Orthography</td></tr>
<tr><td>(6) </td><td>/gε-lokˈmaŋ/ ‘3-head’   </td><td>[gεlokˈmaŋ ~ gεlokoˈmaŋ] </td><td>{gelokmang} ~ {gelokomang}</td></tr>
<tr><td>    </td><td>/bεtˈkol/ ‘grasshopper’ </td><td>[bεtˈkol ~ bεtεˈkol]     </td><td>{betkol} ~ {betekol}</td></tr>
<tr><td>    </td><td>/bilˈkai/ ‘papaya’      </td><td>[bilˈkaj ~ biliˈkaj]     </td><td>{bilkai} ~ {bilikai}</td></tr>
<tr><td>    </td><td>/sakˈpul/ ‘cloud, fog’  </td><td>[sakˈpul ~ sakaˈpul]     </td><td>{sakpul} ~ {sakapul}</td></tr>
<tr><td>    </td><td>/sirˈwis/ ‘work’        </td><td>[sirˈwis ~ siriˈwis]     </td><td>{sirwis} ~ {siriwis}</td></tr>
</table>

In the practical orthography used here, these echo and epenthetic vowels are
written in example sentences where they are uttered by the language consultant.
I include them because in many instances they appear to be required for
utterances to be phonologically well-formed. Head words never include an echo
vowel.

### Agreement morphology

Table 3 presents the four paradigms of agreement prefixes found on nouns and
verbs in Wersing. The analysis of each of these represents a refining of the one
put forward in Schapper and Hendery (2014).

*Table 3.* Wersing agreement prefixes

The relationship between roots, the prefixal series they occur with and the
argument they index is highly lexicalized in Wersing. It therefore constitutes
essential information for many entries in this dictionary (See fields labelled
“Inflectional class” in the dictionary entries). In what follows, I describe the
known distribution and function of each of the four prefixal agreement series.

*Series I.*
This paradigm of agreement prefixes is, by far and away, the most frequently
occurring in Wersing. On vowel-initial roots, the prefixes are realised as per
their underlying forms, with the exception of the 2nd person singular person
which is indicated by the absence of a prefix. On consonant-initial roots, the
consonantal prefixes (i.e., all but 2SG) surface as an unstressed CV syllable,
where the V is epenthetic. As with other epenthetic vowels breaking up initial
consonant clusters, this may be realised as either a schwa or a vowel harmonised
with the left-most root vowel and is written with {è}. Examples are provided in
Table 4.

*Table 4.*  Prefixation of roots with Series I

When used in the nominal domain, Series I prefixes index the possessor of nouns
belonging to the lexical class of inalienably possessed nouns. Examples include
*-atok* ‘belly’ and *-teng* ‘hand/arm’ in the above table. See <a href="#section14">here</a> for more information about possessive classes.

Series I prefixes occur on verbs indexing S, P or A. It is lexically determined
which argument is indexed by a Series I prefix. While the lexical classes of
verb with S and P agreement using a Series I prefix are large, the class with
A agreement has only a handful of members. The following examples illustrate the
different arguments that can be indexed by a Series I prefix:

A handful of verbs show variable agreement behaviour with Series I prefixes.
Differential agreement is typically related to transitivity and semantics.
However, the relationship between prefixed and unprefixed forms of a verb root
is largely idiosyncratic and the different appearances of these roots vis-a-vis
agreement are treated as separate lexical entries in the dictionary. Examples of
verbs occurring with different agreement patterns are:

*Series II.*
This paradigm of agreement prefixes is most commonly used in the nominal domain.
They index the possessor of nouns belonging to the lexical classes of alienably
possessed and obligatorily possessed nouns. See <a href="#section14">here</a> for more information about possessive classes.

With verbs, Series II agreement prefixes make a very limited appearance,
obligatorily indexing either S or P. For the most part, the use of Series II
prefixes appears to be phonologically conditioned, occurring on monosyllabic
verbs beginning with *y* (e.g., *-ya* ‘go down’, *-yok* ‘shake (tr/intr)’) or an
unstressed syllable *tè* (e.g., *-tème* ‘hear’, *-tènar* ‘teach’). Two verb
roots, *-yem* ‘call’ and *-tèter* ‘shiver’, show mixed agreement behaviour,
preferring Series I prefixes in some persons and Series II prefixes in others.
Only one verb taking Series II prefixes does not fit these shapes, *-kui*
‘fart’.

Series II prefixes have an additional use on verbs marking inceptive aspect.
Unlike the above use obligatorily indexing an argument, this use is entirely
optional and occurs to the left of an agreement prefix that is lexically
specified to a verb. Compare the marking of the verb *-tati* ‘stand’ in (11). In
(11a) where the verb shows the normal agreement pattern with a single Series
I prefix indexing S, we have a straightforward sequence of events whereby the
cat moves into a standing position and then jumps on its prey. In (11b) where
both a Series I prefix and, to its left, a series II prefix index S on *-tati*,
the act of standing is only in its first phase: the cat holds itself in
a half-standing position, poised to jump.

*Series III.*
The prefixes of this paradigm are found almost exclusively on verbs marked with
the applicative prefix *le-* (see <a href="#section6">here</a>). The referent coindexed by
a Series III agreement prefix is, with a few exceptions, always the same as the
P applied by *le-*. It is obligatory for first and second person referents of
P to be indexed with a Series III prefix on verbs marked by *le-* (i.e., oblique
pronouns cannot be used), it is optional for third person referents of P. For
example, take the intransitive verb *ko* ‘cry’ (12a). When *le-* is prefixed to
the verb, a second argument, the stimulus for the event is added to the clause.
This second participant can be either encoded with or without a Series III
prefix, (compare 12b and 12c). According to the native speaker judgement I had
access to, where there is no prefix, the stimulus is vaguer; the child cries for
want of the mother, but the mother is no-where to be seen. By contrast, with the
Series III prefix, the child can see the mother and she is directly available to
respond to the child’s demands.

<tr><td>(12)  </td><td>a.  </td><td><i>ol</i>  </td><td><i>pok</i>  </td><td colspan="2"><i><b>ko</b></i></td></tr>

<tr><td>      </td><td>    </td><td colspan="4">‘A child cries for its mother (who is visible/available).’</td></tr>
</table>

In the dictionary there are only two intransitive verbs marked by *le-* which
are known to be able to take a Series III prefix indexing their S argument,
*lesèweri* ‘be scattered about’ and *-leboli* ‘be without success’. The use of
Series III prefixes to index an S argument on an *le*-marked verb may be
available on more roots than the materials collected here make clear.

Because a Series III prefix occurs to the left of *le-*, it is in a different
slot to a Series I prefix, which always occurs closest to the root. The two can,
therefore, cooccur. For example, when marked by *le-*, the verb *-mur* ‘run’ in
(13) hosts a Series I prefix for the derived A (S of the verb in its underived
form) and a Series III prefix for the applied P.

<table class="unstyled">
<tr><td>(13)  </td><td><i>naida</i>  </td><td><i>ne-ya</i>   </td><td><i><b>ga-le-nè-mur-a</b></i></td></tr>
<tr><td>      </td><td>1SG.TOP       </td><td>1SG.II-mother  </td><td>3.III-APPL-1SG.I-run-FIN</td></tr>
<tr><td>      </td><td colspan="3">‘I run from my mother.’</td></tr>
</table>

There are only two intransitive verbs without *le-* on which a Series III prefix
is known to occur: *-mèra* ‘want’ and *-mèlosi* ‘not want’. On these two verbs,
the appearance of the Series III prefix is obligatory and can be considered to
be in the same slot as other obligatory agreement prefixes of Series I and, to
a lesser extent, Series II. Given that the two verbs share the same initial
unstressed syllable *mè* and that they are the only verbs of that shape to take
agreement prefixes, it seems likely that this use of Series III is
phonologically conditioned.

*Series IV.*
The prefixes of this paradigm are found only on verbs and are the least frequent
prefixal series in my data. Schapper and Hendery (2014) tentatively suggest that
Series IV prefixes may be contractions of Series I prefixes and applicative *le-*.
On examination of more data, this suggestion does not seem to be supported.
However, the functions of the Series IV prefixes remain poorly understood and
the account provided here is still preliminary.

The single most frequently attested use of Series IV prefixes is indexing P with
at least some transitive verbs. In a similar manner to Series III prefixes with
*le-*, on four verb roots it is obligatory for first and second person referents
of P to be indexed with a Series III prefix on these verbs, but it is optional
for third person referents of P. On two further transitive verb roots, this
pattern in suspected, but I lack examples without the Series IV prefix in the
third person to confirm this.

On two other verb roots, the use of Series IV prefixes adds a second participant
and is associated with a change in meaning. The intransitive verbs *-sir*
(Series I prefixes for S) ‘descend’ and *tèbel* ‘wrong’ can both take a Series
IV prefix indexing a P (replacing the Series I prefix on the former root) to
mean ‘bear, give birth to (lit. descend out of)’ and ‘blame’, respectively.

On only one intransitive verb in my corpus, *lalang* ‘sick’, is a Series IV
prefix used for S. Here the prefix is optional and, where it is used, denotes
greater affectedness of S. However, because the pattern is, at this stage, only
known from a single verb and it is not clear that it is generalized, I list the
prefixed and unprefixed form of this verb as separate lexical entries.

### Applicative morphology

Wersing has two applicative prefixes: *le-* and *mi-*. Each has several
frequently occurring functions, most applicativizing, but others not. See the
entries for each of the applicative prefixes for details.

While many appearances of applicative prefixes on roots yield predicable
semantics, there is also a reasonable amount of lexicalization to be observed.
Take, for instance, *boli* ‘bad’ which becomes *le-boli* ‘wounded’ and *naung*
‘not’ becomes *mi-naung* ‘disappear, be not present’. While the semantic
relationship between these unprefixed roots and their applicative-marked forms
is not difficult to perceive, there is an element of unpredictability in the
semantics of applicative-marked forms.

In addition, some roots do not exist in a “bare” form. These are of two types.
The first involves forms which are invariable. For example, the root *alar* is
only known to occur as *mi-alar* ‘sail’ in Wersing, but it is clear that *mi-*
is an applicative on etymological grounds. The second involves roots that only
occur in morphologically complex forms including with applicative prefixes. For
example, the bare root *sebi* is not attested in Wersing, but it is found in the
applicative marked forms *le-sebi* ‘ask about’ and *-le-sebi* ‘ask of’, and the
compound *-mak sebi* ‘ask (someone)’.

For these reasons, applicative prefix-marked roots are listed in the dictionary
as separate lexical entries. The only exception to this is numerals, a word
class for which there appears to be a complete lack of lexicalization in
meanings of applicative marked forms. Because of this, I do not list
applicative-marked numerals separately. The reader should note that I have not
systematically checked the availability of each of the two applicative prefixes
on roots. Therefore, absence of an applicative-marked root from the dictionary
should not be taken to indicate its non-existence.

### Metathesis and final/nonfinal contrasts

Wersing has a synchronic process of metathesis involving final unstressed
syllables containing a high vowel. The default shape of a word displaying
metathesis i.e., the form which is given in elicitation or list contexts,
differs in Wersing depending on the consonant involved in the metathesis. Where
the metathesising consonant is n (with ŋ as its final allophone), the default
shape is (CV)ˈCV*V[+high]ŋ* and the metathesised shape is (CV)ˈCV*nV[+high]*. By
contrast, lexemes that do not have n as the metathesising consonant have the
default shape (CV)ˈCV*CV[+high]* and the metathesised shape is
(CV)ˈCV*V[+high]C*.<a href="#ref3" id="3" data-toggle="tooltip" title="I know of two items on which metathesised forms take a different shape: mèduli ‘suck’ becomes mudil, while sruing ‘rifle’ becomes surin-."><sup>3</sup></a>.
I use the default shape as the citation form, i.e., the form given as the
headword in the dictionary. The metathesised form of an item is given after
information, if any, about inflectional class. Note, again, that I have not
systematically checked the availability of metathesis on roots of the
appropriate shape; metathesised forms are only recorded where they were offered
by the speaker I worked with as alternative shapes or were spontaneously
produced, e.g., as part of example sentences for other head words.

Metathesis is triggered on nouns by encliticisation of *=a* ‘SPEC’ (compare
*saku* ‘elder’ in 14a and 14b) and on some verbs by suffixation of *-a* ‘FIN’ to
final predicates (compare *-tati* ‘stand’ in 15a and 15b). The suffix *-a* ‘FIN’
on these and other predicates was described as a realis marker by Schapper and
Hendery (2014) because it marks that a situation or event has been realized and
is a statement of fact.

</table>

On other verbs, it does not appear that *-a* ‘FIN’ can be used. Instead,
metathesis is triggered on these by syntactic position. In a non-final position
in the clause the consonant-final form is used (a examples in 16 and 17), while
the vowel-final forms are used in clause final position (b examples in 16
and17). The vowel-final forms of these verbs seem to carry with them the same
realis mood denoted by *-a* ‘FIN’ on other verbs.

The final/nonfinal distinction is not only manifested in Wersing by means of
*-a* ‘FIN’ and metathesis on verbs, but is also found with a range of other
items involving an unproductive *-ng* ‘NFIN’ suffix. For example, the priorative
marker has the non-final form *teng* (18a) and the final (encliticizing) form
*=te* (18b).

### Parallel compounds

“Parallelism” is used here to refer to a pattern of coordinative compounding
that functions to expand the Wersing lexicon of nouns and verbs. “Parallel”
compounds involve compounding of noun with noun or verb with verb, where the
relation between members is like one of coordination.<a href="#ref4" id="4" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Other terms exist in the literature for such compounds, including ‘coordinative’ compounds, ‘dvandva’ compounds, ‘appositional’ compounds, and ‘co-compounds’. The term ‘parallel’ compound is used here, because it is the established term for the eastern Indonesian region where Wersing is spoken. In this region parallel compounds are one expression of what is a wider pattern of parallelism or dyadic pairing in language pevading different speech levels (see Grimes et al. 1997: 15ff)."><sup>4</sup></a>.
The pairing of items together in parallel compounds is lexically fixed, as is
the order of items in the compounds; new parallel compounds are not readily
coined and switching the order of items in already existing ones results in
ungrammaticality. The nouns and verbs of a parallel compound occur within
a single intonation contour; no pause may intervene between the two Ns or Vs
compounded together. They also cannot be independently modified or determined.

Parallel compounds may be created by compounding together items that are
(near-)synonyms, antonyms or specific terms denoting related actions or
referents. When verbs are compounded together, parallel compounds have meanings
denoting intensive situations, repetitive actions or multitudes of participants
(examples given in 20). When two nouns are compounded together, parallel
compounds create a general cover term for a unitary category or denote plurality
of kinds (examples given in 21).

<table class="unstyled">

<tr><td>      </td><td><i>idem olik</i> ‘all the family, everyone’           </td><td>&lt; <i>idem</i> ‘senior relative’, <i>olik</i> ‘junior relative’</td></tr>
</table>

In many Wersing parallel compounds, one member of the compound, typically the
second member, does not occur independently outside of the compound. In these
cases, speakers typically say that the non-independent member ‘means the same
thing’ as the other item in the compound. Examples are given in (22). A question
mark ‘?’ indicates that the item does not occur outside the compound.

<table class="unstyled">
<tr><td>(22)  </td><td><i>kowas bis</i> ‘very rich, very wealthy’                    </td><td>&lt; <i>kowas</i> ‘rich’, <i>bis</i> ?</td></tr>
<tr><td>      </td><td><i>yer salu</i>  ‘laugh a lot’                                </td><td>&lt; <i>yer</i> ‘laugh’, <i>salu</i> ?</td></tr>
<tr><td>      </td><td><i>bisar mèngada</i> ‘converse, talk back and forth’          </td><td>&lt; <i>bisar</i> ‘speak’, <i>mèngada</i> ?</td></tr>

<tr><td>      </td><td><i>-wak -lolol</i> ‘all four legs, limbs’                     </td><td>&lt; <i>-wak</i> ‘foot’, <i>-lolol</i> ?</td></tr>
<tr><td>      </td><td><i>moi -barang</i> ‘both shoulders’                           </td><td>&lt; <i>-moi</i> ?, <i>-barang</i> ‘shoulder’</td></tr>
</table>

Because of the highly lexicalised nature of parallel compounds in Wersing, they
are given their own separate entries in this dictionary.


The dictionary
--------------

### Structure and content of dictionary entries

Every entry contains minimally a lexeme written in the Wersing orthography
established here, information on pronunciation, the lexeme’s part of speech and
an English translation. These the obligatory fields for all lexical entries:

 * Headword (lemma): where a lemma is a noun or verb marked with an initial hyphen "-", this indicates that is must be inflected with a person-number prefix
 
 * Pronunciation: broad IPA rendering of head word including stress and
   agreement prefix shape (see <a href="#section3">Wersing phonology and morphology</a> on Wersing phonology)
   
 * Part of speech: word class designation (abbreviations and explanations of the
   characteristics of each part of speech can be found in <a href="#section12">here</a>)
   
 * Meaning description: approximate definition in English

Most entries also contain example phrases or sentences as follows:

 * Example sentence in Wersing
 
 * English translation

Where relevant and available, I include additional information in the following
optional fields:

 * Inflectional class: for nouns and verbs, this field provides information
   about the series of agreement prefix (I, II, III or IV) a root hosts; where
   no inflectional class information is given, a root is not part of a closed
   inflectional class (see <a href="#section5">Agreement morphology</a> on the distribution and function of
   agreement prefixes, and <a href="#section6">Applicative morphology</a> on the verbal and nominal classes they
   define).

 * Metathesised form: for lexical items with the appropriate shape, this field
   gives their metathesised shape (see <a href="#section7">Metathesis and final/nonfinal contrasts</a> for details on metathesis as
   a process).

 * Morphological structure: where a head word is polymorphemic complex
   (excluding agreement prefixes which are not given in headwords), this is
   indicated in this field.

 * Grammatical note: This field provides extra information about the grammatical
   behaviour of a headword, often in one of its senses.

 * Phonological note: This field provides extra information about the
   phonological behaviour of a headword.

 * Variant: This field is used for noting unpredictable variants of a headword,
   e.g., where an unstressed vowel can irregularly be reduced to schwa, or where
   a short form of a morphologically complex headword exists

 * Borrowed word: This field provides information about borrowings from
   Austronesian languages. Often the precise source language is not known, but
   indicative forms from nearby Austronesian languages are provided, along with
   Austronesian etymologies where they are available.

Parts of speech
---------------

Parts of speech can be identified on the basis of their morphosyntactic
properties. After each headword in the dictionary, information is given about
that word’s part of speech. Table 5 lists all parts of speech which the
dictionary contains. The properties of these parts of speech are set out in
brief below.

Some words can belong to more than one word class in Wersing. For example, *pèdot*
is an intransitive verb meaning ‘old (of things)’ and an adverb meaning ‘for
a long time’; *muing* is an intransitive verb meaning ‘emit a smell, stink’ and
a noun ‘smell, stink’. Because the *Dictionaria* structure does not permit
multiple word class specifications per head word, words belonging to more than
one word class get split over separate entries. This means that they are treated
in the same way as homophones, even though they are not.

### Verbs

Verbs in Wersing are defined by the fact that they have valency and take
arguments. Intransitive verbs (vi) take a single argument, S. Transitive verbs
(vt) take two arguments, A and P. A small number of verbs are optionally
ditransitive (vd/t), taking A, T and R.

Verbs can be divided into inflection classes based on their agreement behaviour.
There are three parameters of variation here:

 * Series of agreement prefix used
 
 * Argument indexed by agreement prefix
 
 * Obligatoriness of agreement prefix

Semantics plays little to no role in determining inflectional class; assignment
is entirely lexical.

The largest class of verbs are those that never take an agreement prefix for any
of their arguments. This open class is indicated in the dictionary by the
absence of information on inflectional class.

For those verbs that do take agreement prefixes, this is noted with a roman
numeral (I, II, III, IV) indicating the series of the inflection followed by
a letter (A, S, P, R) indicating the argument that the prefix indexed, e.g., I_A
indicates that the verb takes a Series I prefix indexing the A argument. Where
a verb only optionally takes an agreement prefix (without any significant change
in meaning), this is indicated by brackets around the roman numeral and letter,
e.g., (III_P) indicates that the P argument can be optionally indexing with
a Series III prefix (as is common for transitive verbs marked with *le-*).

### Nouns

Nouns are divided into three lexical classes based on the coding of their
possessor. They are:

 * *Alienably possessed nouns:* large open class of nouns on which a possessor is
   coded with Series II prefixes, but is never obligatory

 * *Inalienably possessed nouns (inal):* closed class of nouns, typically
   denoting body parts, on which a possessor is obligatorily coded with
   Series I prefixes

 * *Obligatorily possessed nouns (obl):* closed class of nouns, typically
   denoting kin terms and body parts, on which a possessor is obligatory coded,
   either as a Series II prefix or as a simple N in a possessive compound

Because their membership is lexically determined, only nouns belonging to the
latter two classes are indicated in the field “Inflectional class” (abbreviated
as “inal” and “obl”) in the dictionary. Nouns with no inflectional class
information in the dictionary belong to the open class of alienably possessed
nouns.

In a few cases, nouns may belong to more than one class. For example, *lèmi* is
an alienably possessed noun meaning ‘man’, but an obligatory possessed meaning
‘husband’. Where a root belongs to two separate inflectional classes, they are
listed as separate entries in the dictionary.

### Multiword phrases
In the Wersing dictionary I include two kinds of multiword phrases that involve conventionalised combinations of nouns and verbs. These are not compounds; in each case the noun can be expanded into a noun phrase, for example, by being marked with the definite article. 

*Subject phrases.*
Abbreviated as n+vi, these are conventionalised combinations of a bodypart noun in the S role together with an intransitive verb. 

*Object phrases.*
Abbreviated as n+vt, these are conventionalised combinations of a noun in the P role together with a transitive verb.

### Pronouns

Pronouns in Wersing are, for our purposes, personal pronouns. They are marked
for person, number, and clusivity. Like other Timor-Alor-Pantar languages,
Wersing has numerous paradigms of pronouns, marking variously agentivity, topic,
focus, quantity and possession (see Schapper and Hendery 2014 for description of
the functions of some paradigms). All pronouns are morphologically complex, but
cannot be easily broken down into component morphemes synchronically. Table
9 presents the different paradigms of pronouns identified thus far.

### Demonstratives and articles

Demonstratives in Wersing are defined by the fact that they are distanced marked
for proximal versus distal. There are different sets of demonstrative and most
of them are characterised by their hosting of the deictic prefixes *o-* ‘PROX’
and *a-* ‘DIST’. Otherwise the different sets of demonstrative do not share
morphosyntactic properties in common.

Two sets of demonstrative, the nominal and clausal demonstratives, form
a paradigm with articles. Together they are called ‘determiners’ here (Table
10). In the nominal domain, there are two articles *=a* ‘SPEC’ and *ba* ‘DEF’,
in the clausal domain only one, *bo* ‘EMPH’. Only one determiner can be used per
NP/clause.

<table class="table table-bordered">
<thead>
<tr><th>         </th><th colspan="2"> Nominal  </th><th> Clausal </th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Article  </td><td><em>=a</em></td><td><em>ba</em></td><td><em>bo</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>Proximal </td><td colspan="2"><em>oba</em></td><td><em>obo</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>Distal   </td><td colspan="2"><em>aba</em></td><td><em>abo</em></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

*Table 10.* Determiners

Another two sets of demonstrative, the restrictive and interrogative
demonstratives, can be used pronominally in “identificational” contexts (Table
11). The functions of these demonstratives are not well-understood at this
stage.

<table class="table table-bordered">

<tr>
<td><em>a(po)kida</em></td>
<td><em>atrona</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

*Table 11.* Pronominal demonstrative

Locative demonstratives (Table 12) refer to location by distance. The proximal
and distal forms are based on the locative postposition *=mi* ‘LOC’ and its
predicative counterpart *ming/mina* ‘BE.LOC.NFIN/FIN’. The non-predicative
locative demonstratives are notable for their added distance dimension,
a super-distal indicating a location far from both speaker and addressee, that
is not found with any other demonstrative set.

</table>

*Table 12.* Locative demonstratives

The final set of demonstratives are manner demonstratives (Table 13). These
differ from other sets in that they do not show marking with the deictic
prefixes *o-* ‘PROX’ and *a-* ‘DIST’.

<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><td>Proximal</td><td>pang</td></tr>
<tr><td>Distal</td><td>pong</td></tr>
</table>

*Table 13.* Manner demonstratives

### Elevationals

As in other TAP languages, Wersing has a set of elevationals (Table 14). These
distinguish locations on three levels of elevation relative to the deictic
centre: LEVEL ‘location at same elevation as the deictic centre’, HIGH ‘location
at a higher elevation than the deictic centre’, and LOW ‘location at a lower
elevation than the deictic centre’.

<table class="table table-bordered" style="table-layout:fixed;">

</tr>
<tr>
<td>LOW</td>
<td><em>yong</em></td>
<td><em>=yo</em></td>
<td><em>yono</em></td>
<td><em>yona</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

*Table 14.* Elevationals

Like locative demonstratives, elevationals have different forms for final and
nonfinal positions. At this stage it is not fully understood what governs the
choice between different final forms of the elevationals. The enclitic forms and
the forms ending in /o/ cannot stand on their own and must combine with a verb,
while forms in /a/ can act as stand-alone predicates.

### Numerals and classifiers

*Numerals.*
In Wersing numerals are defined by their ability to be used either by themselves
or in combination with one another to denote specific quantities.  Wersing has
simple numerals for the numbers ‘one’ to ‘six’. Higher numerals involve
combinations based on the numeral *weting* ‘five’, *adayoku* ‘ten’, *aska*
‘hundred’ or *ribu* ‘thousand’. Specifically, Wersing makes use of a quinary
base for forming numerals ‘seven’ to ‘nine’ (e.g., *weting tu* five-three
‘eight’) and a decimal base for ‘ten’ and above (e.g., *adayoku mi-yoku gresing
tu ten* MULTIPLY-two plus three ‘twenty-three’).

*Classifiers.*
Wersing has a very small number of dedicated numeral classifiers that optionally
occur between a noun and a numeral. These classifiers are items that co-occur in
the context of a numeral, classifying the referent of a noun that is being
counted. I do not count items to the class of classifiers that can independently
occur as nouns, even though there are several that regularly appear between
nouns and numerals, e.g., *iko* ‘seed’.

Like other Alor-Pantar languages, Wersing also has an obligatory inflecting
classifier used when enumerating human referents with a numeral above ‘one’,
e.g., <em>saku mei <strong>ganing weting</strong></em> old.person female
**3.CLF:HUM five** ‘five old ladies’.  The inflectional pattern of the human
numeral classifier makes it similar to a paradigm of pronouns (as given above in
Table 9).

### Conjoiners, connectors and coordinators

Wersing has three small classes that are used to join linguistic units to one
another.

*Conjoiners.*
Wersing has a small number of enclitic clause conjoiners (conj) that attach to the end
of a clause and conjoin it to a following one. The enclitic clause conjoiners
often attach to the pronoun *geweng* where they still occur at the end of the
clause.

*Sentence connectors.*
These are clause-initial elements (conn) used to link one clause to another. Enclitic
clause conjoiners can form sentence connectors when they mark the manner
demonstrative *pang*.

*Coordinators.*
Wersing has two coordinators (coord) that are used to connect words of the same part
that are to be taken either jointly or as alternatives to one another.

### Plural words

Wersing has two plural words. These are independent words that occur in the NP
to optionally mark the plurality of the NP referent. Other non-numeral
quantifiers appear to be intransitive verbs.

### Interrogatives and question tags

Interrogatives (inter) are lexical items that occur in questions indicating what part of
the proposition the asker wishes to know about. They may be used pronominally, adnominally and sometimes adverbially.

Question tags (tag) can be used to mark polar questions. They appear as the last
element in a clause and are accompanied by rising intonation.

### Adpositions

Adposition is not a unitary category in Wersing.

The language has one postposition (postp) *=mi* marking locative relations. This is an
enclitic that attaches to a noun or noun phrase to specify its location with
regard to the clause; it can never act as the head of an independent predicate.
The postposition is related to the verb *ming ~ mina* ‘be in, at’ and the
applicative prefix *mi-* ‘LOC’.

Similative relations may be expressed by either a preposition (prep) *iwe* [NP] or
a related circumposition (circump) *iwe* [NP] *gèning* ‘be alike to, be similar to’.
Unlike the locative postposition *=mi*, the simulative pre/circumposition can
act independently as a predicate.

A final preposition *lèmang* ‘until’ (also a sentence connector) exists in
Wersing. Like the locative postposition *=mi*, this item cannot stand as an
independent predicate.

### Interjections

These are words that are typically uttered in isolation, without syntactic
integration in the clause. These include a small number of “vocatives”,
a subclass of interjections expressing the identity of the party spoken to.

### Adverbs

Adverbs (adv) are defined here as modifiers of constituents in the clause other than
nouns. This is a sizeable but highly heterogenous group that can be treated as
a unitary “class” with difficulty. They can be used to express time, manner,
aspect, negation and occur in many different positions in the clause.

### Particles

Particles (part) are a small heterogenous group of items that chiefly fulfil semantic
and pragmatic functions.


Acknowledgments
---------------

I thank the following organisations for financial support of my work on Wersing:
the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (VENI project “The
evolution of the lexicon: Explorations in lexical stability, semantic shift and
borrowing in a Papuan language family”), the Volkswagen Stiftung (DoBeS project
“Aru languages documentation”), the Australian Research Council (project
DP180100893 “Waves of words”), and the European Research Council OUTOFPAPUA
project, grant agreement no. 848532).

Most importantly, I thank Hans Retebana for his extremely dedicated work and
interest in this dictionary. We hope to print an Indonesian version of the
Wersing dictionary for the community in the near future.

Discussions from various colleagues working on other languages of the
Timor-Alor-Pantar family have also helped immensely: Emilie Wellfelt, Rachel Hendery, Alex
Veloso, Juliette Huber, Hein Steinhauer. Discussions about borrowing from
Austronesian languages have also been helpful, and here I thank Chuck Grimes,
Owen Edwards, Timothy Usher and Sander Adelaar.


Footnotes

<a href="#1" id="ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Such weak glottal stop epenthesis/vowel lengthening has also been observed on one vowel-initial item also: /le-adu/ ‘lean on’ [lɛadu ~ laʔadu ~ laːdu]. It may be that the root here is, in fact, /-jadu/.<br>
<a href="#2" id="ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Word-initial vowels, stressed or unstressed, have not been lost. In a few instances, an original pretonic vowel is found preserved in a morphologically derived form of the root. For example, compare /ttuk/ ‘talk, speak’ with derived transitive form /ˈnatutuk/ ‘inform, let know’. Because the prefix /na-/ attracts stress, the /u/ vowel of the initial syllable of the root in this item was not in a pretonic position and so did not reduce.<br>
<a href="#3" id="ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> I know of two items on which metathesised forms take a different shape: <i>mèduli</i> ‘suck’ becomes <i>mudil</i>, while <i>sruing</i> ‘rifle’ becomes <i>surin-</i>.<br>
<a href="#4" id="ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Other terms exist in the literature for such compounds, including ‘coordinative’ compounds, ‘dvandva’ compounds, ‘appositional’ compounds, and ‘co-compounds’. The term ‘parallel’ compound is used here, because it is the established term for the eastern Indonesian region where Wersing is spoken. In this region parallel compounds are one expression of what is a wider pattern of parallelism or dyadic pairing in language pervading different speech levels (see Grimes et al. 1997: 15ff).<br>
